Pebble-Communicator
===================

An iOS app that allows two-way communication between an iOS Device and its connected Pebble Watch.

This initial version is very limited, as it was made more to demonstrate that with some workarounds you can still do some interesting things with Pebble, even if the full SDK isn't out yet.

__How To Use__

1. Make sure your Pebble is connected to your iOS Device.
2. Launch Pebble Communicator.
3. On the Pebble, press the "Next" and "Previous" track buttons to select a character, and then press "Play" to type the letter.

Originally, this was meant to be able to send text messages, but it appears with iOS 6 Apple has dramatically changed the private APIs required for this, and I could not find a way to do it. I know it's possible, but if you have any ideas feel free to let me know!
